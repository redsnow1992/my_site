# Vectors and Linear Equations
**Two equations**     $ x-2y = 11$
**Two unknowns** 
![row picture]()
ROWS The row picfure shows two lines meeting at a single point(the solution).
COLUMNS The column picture combines the column vectors on the left side to produce the vector b on the right side.

It is a lot easier to see a combination of four vectors in four-dimensional
space, than to visualize how four hyperplanes might possibly meet at a point. (Even one
hyperplane is hard enough ... )
